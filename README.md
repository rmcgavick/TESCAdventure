This was the unfinished result of Code Day in Seattle, 2013. This was an attempt at a silly rpg-style game inspired by my previous college - The Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA. I was working with 3 other people but we never finished this game. Nevertheless, the code we did complete is here in case we ever decide to finish the game.
